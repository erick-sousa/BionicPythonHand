# BionicPythonHand

## Background
This program stems from a project to design and create a functional bionic hand using an Arduino and 5 servo motors. All CAD models were made in Fusion360, and the parts were 3D printed with my Artillery Sidewinder X1. Below is a picture of the CAD model I created.

## This Repository 
After fully manufacturing the hand and making it work through the Arduino IDE, I hoped to further explore it's capabilities by creating a program that would allow me to control the hand through Python. This opened the door to a lot of more creative functionalities for the hand. The code found in this repository is one of my first attempts at working with objects in Python, so there are some inefficiencies and redundancies that need to worked out, but overall the code works.
